# Front Panel

This folder describes STRACHEY's front panel.

I designed the panel in KiCad. I've been using KiCad for panel design for over a year so (unlike in electronic aspects of this project) I can't claim to be a new user - but I can confirm that KiCad is great for designing front panels.

There is a [.pcb file](https://github.com/m0xpd/STRACHEY/blob/main/Hardware/Panel/Strachey%20Panel.kicad_pcb) and a [.pro file](https://github.com/m0xpd/STRACHEY/blob/main/Hardware/Panel/Strachey%20Panel.kicad_pro) which together make a KiCad project for the Panel (the schematic is, of course, trivial as the panel has no electrical connections).

These add up to a panel which [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) made for my prototype system in aluminium in black with white silkscreen (as per the design). JLC did their usual excellent job (usual disclaimer), but this white on "black on an aluminium substrate" recipe is very expensive. If you want to save money, you should either change the design to black on white on an aluminium panel or change to an FR4 panel. 

You can see the front and rear sides of the prototype panel in the image below:
