# Controller

This folder contains details of the code which implements the STRACHEY sequencer.

I originally intended to build the code on an STM32, expecting that both the I/O requirements and the complexity of the application would take me beyond the scope of simpler microcontrollers. 
However, I found that I could just fit the features I had targetted into code for a simple little ARDUINO NANO - so that is what has been used.

There is an Arduino script in the Code folder.
